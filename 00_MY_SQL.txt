executing one command multiple time can give errors

CREATE DATABASE if not exists name;    #create database if not exists
DROP DATABASE if exists name;      #delete database
USE name;                #use database

CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);  #create table

SQL Data Types (numeric datatypes):
Signed datatype (-128-127)- INT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, BIGINT, TINYINT, YEAR
Unsigned datatype (0-255)- INT UNSIGNED, SMALLINT UNSIGNED, MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED, BIGINT UNSIGNED, TINYINT UNSIGNED

<----------------------SQL commands---------------------->

DDL (Data Definition Language) - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
DML (Data Manipulation Language) - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, CALL, EXPLAIN PLAN, LOCK TABLE
DCL (Data Control Language) - GRANT, REVOKE
TCL (Transaction Control Language) - COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, SET TRANSACTION
DQL (Data Query Language) - SELECT

<----------------------SAFE MODE---------------------->

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;  #to disable safe mode
safe mode is used to prevent sql injection

<----------------------show command---------------------->
show databases;
show tables;
show columns from table_name;

<----------------------basic sql commands---------------------->
SELECT * FROM table_name;     #select all columns from table
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;   #select specific columns from table

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);  #insert values into table
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ...);  #insert values into table

UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;  #update values in table

PRIMARY KEY - It is a column in table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It is used to ensure that no two rows in the table have the same value for this column. (like index numbers or a unique id)
FOREIGN KEY - It is a column in table that references a primary key in another table. It is used to establish a relationship between tables.


<----------------------Constraints---------------------->

NOT NULL - This constraint prevents null values from being inserted into the column.
UNIQUE - This constraint prevents duplicate values from being inserted into the column.
PRIMARY KEY - This constraint makes the column a primary key, which is a unique identifier for each row in the table.  

we can make PRIMARY KEY with multiple values like 
    PRIMARY KEY(id,name) it means the combination wont be copied
 
FOREIGN KEY - This constraint makes the column a foreign key, which is a reference to a primary key in another table. 
    FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES table_name (column_name)

DEFAULT it will set the default value for the column if no value is provided when inserting a new row into the table. 
    salary INT DEFAULT 50000;

CONSTRAINTS - it limits the values that allowd into the column.

SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;  #select unique values from column that are not repeated

<----------------------Aggregates---------------------->

WHERE  - it is used to filter rows based on a condition.
ORDER BY - it is used to sort rows based on one or more columns.
GROUP BY - it is used to group rows based on one or more columns.
HAVING - it is used to filter groups based on a condition.
LIMIT - it is used to limit the number of rows returned.

<-------- WHERE CLAUSE -------->
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30 AND salary > 50000;            #select all employees older than 30 years and with a salary greater than 50000
we can use all operators in where clause like =, !=, >, <, >=, <=, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, AND, OR, NOT, EXISTS, ANY, ALL, SOME, EVERY, MATCH, CONTAINS, STARTSWITH, ENDSWITH, CONTAINSKEYWORD

<-------- ORDER BY CLAUSE -------->
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC;   #sort in ascending order
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name DESC;  #sort in descending order

<-------- LIMIT CLAUSE -------->
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name LIMIT n;  #select the first n rows
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name LIMIT n OFFSET m;  #select the first n rows starting from the mth row

            SELECT → FROM → WHERE → ORDER BY → LIMIT

AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS - its like inbuilt FUNCTIONS
COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;

<----------------------GROUP BY CLAUSE---------------------->

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name;   


<----------------------HAVING CLAUSE---------------------->

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name GROUP BY column_name HAVING condition;

SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition                         - it will filter the rows
GROUP BY column_name 
HAVING condition;                       - it will filter the groups
ORDER BY column_name ASC;               - it will sort the rows

<----------------------TABLE RELATED QUERIES---------------------->
UPDATE table_name 
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... 
WHERE condition;  #update values in table
